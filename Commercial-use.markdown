## Slicer Based Products and Product Prototypes
{: .heading}

Many companies prefer not to disclose what software components they use in their products, therefore here we can only list a few commercial products that are based on 3D Slicer,

* Allen Institute for Brain Science, Cell Locator, Desktop application for manually aligning specimens to annotated 3D spaces.
* Radiopharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry, RPTDose, a 3D Slicer-based application that streamlines and integrates quantitative imaging analysis and dose estimation techniques to guide and optimize the use of radiopharmaceutical therapy agents in clinical trials. See more information on Kitware blog.
